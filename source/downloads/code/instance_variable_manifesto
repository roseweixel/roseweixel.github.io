prefixes for instance variables
@	
	- only in the initialize method

self.	
	- if you have an equals sign (=, +=, *=, -=, etc…) and you have made an attr_writer if you don’t have an attr_writer, don’t use self., because it will try to call a method that does not exist (in which case you should probably make an attr_writer, otherwise it seems you would have to use @!)

nil	
	- every other time!

It’s always safe to use self.!
