    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After spending six weeks in Ruby land, last week was all JavaScript all the time at <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">The Flatiron School</a>. I feel like I&rsquo;ve just added a hammer with superpowers to my programming tool box. You might bend a few nails along the way, but you can build almost anything with it.</p>

<p>Also, JavaScript is weird. Although it cares a lot about semi-colons, there are some important ways in which, just like the honey badger, it just doesn&rsquo;t seem to care at all. Here I will attempt to get comfortable with this strange new animal by diving deep into some of its more surprising aspects. To provide some contrast and context, especially for those who (like myself) are more at home with Ruby, I&rsquo;ll make some comparisons as I go along.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dive right in. For comparison, here is some Ruby:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby javascript-ruby-comparison/ruby.rb">dog = 'Fido'

def bark
  puts "#{dog} says woof"
end

bark
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby, a method is a scope gate, so <code>dog</code> is not defined in the <code>bark</code> method. Ruby will tell you this in no uncertain terms:</p>

<pre><code class="console">[18:12:24] javascript-ruby-comparison
♥ ruby ruby.rb
ruby.rb:4:in `bark': undefined local variable or method `dog' for main:Object (NameError)
    from ruby.rb:7:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>On line 4, Ruby has no idea about what <code>dog</code> is, because the universe in line 4 is the local scope of the method <code>bark</code>. This scope gate can be very nice, since it means we cannot accidentally overwrite a variable we defined in the global scope from within a method. In order to make <code>dog</code> into a global variable that we can access inside the method, Ruby requires us to be very explicit about it, putting a <code>$</code> in front of that variable both where it is defined and wherever it is referenced:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby javascript-ruby-comparison/ruby.rb">$dog = 'Fido'

def bark
  puts "#{$dog} says woof"
end

bark
</code></pre>

<p>Now we clearly see that we are playing with a global variable, and Ruby plays along:</p>

<pre><code class="console">[18:32:01] javascript-ruby-comparison
♥ ruby ruby.rb
Fido says woof
</code></pre>

<p>While JavaScript does have a concept of functions creating a new scope, variables assigned outside of those functions can easily be accessed from within:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript javascript-ruby-comparison/javascript.js">var dog = 'Fido'

function bark(){
  console.log(dog + ' says woof');
}

bark();
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript doesn&rsquo;t care if you want to reach outside the function&rsquo;s scope to grab a variable. JavaScript functions have knowledge of the universe around them:
<code>console
[18:38:34] javascript-ruby-comparison
♥ jsc javascript.js
--&gt; Fido says woof
</code></p>

<p>So what else can you do with a variable defined outside a function from within a function? As it turns out, JavaScript will let you do whatever you want:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript javascript-ruby-comparison/javascript.js">var dog = 'Fido'

function bark(){
  dog = 'Spot'
  debug(dog + ' says woof from within the function');
}

debug(dog + ' says woof outside of the function');
bark();
debug(dog + ' says woof after the function is called');
</code></pre>

<p>What happened to Fido?</p>

<pre><code class="console">[20:47:14] javascript-ruby-comparison
♥ jsc javascript.js 
--&gt; Fido says woof outside of the function
--&gt; Spot says woof from within the function
--&gt; Spot says woof after the function is called
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like the name change was permanent. And by the way, by always using <code>var</code>, we can prevent such dangers:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript javascript-ruby-comparison/javascript.js">var dog = 'Fido'

function bark(){
  var dog = 'Spot'
  debug(dog + ' says woof from within the function');
}

debug(dog + ' says woof outside of the function');
bark();
debug(dog + ' says woof after the function is called');
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="console">♥ jsc javascript.js 
--&gt; Fido says woof outside of the function
--&gt; Spot says woof from within the function
--&gt; Fido says woof after the function is called
</code></pre>

<p>By using <code>var</code> within the function, we created an entirely different <code>dog</code> and did not alter the original.</p>

<h2>Arity Schmarity</h2>

<p>Before we go any further, I must admit that hadn&rsquo;t heard the word arity until I crossed paths with JavaScript. I reckon I&rsquo;m not alone in this, so here&rsquo;s a definition courtesy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In logic, mathematics, and computer science, the <strong>arity</strong> of a function or operation is the number of arguments or operands the function or operation accepts.</p></blockquote>

<p>OK. This sounds like something I know from Ruby land. Here&rsquo;s a familiar example:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby javascript-ruby-comparison/ruby.rb">class Dog
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>According to the above definition, the <code>initialize</code> method of the <code>Dog</code> class takes exactly one argument. You could say its arity is one (more commonly, this is known as a unary function).</p>

<p>Ruby cares about arity, and will give you very nice error messages to make you aware of this:</p>

<pre><code class="console">2.1.2 :002 &gt; require 'ruby.rb'
 =&gt; true 
2.1.2 :003 &gt; fido = Dog.new
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)
    from /Users/rose/Development/code/javascript-ruby-comparison/ruby.rb:3:in `initialize'
    from (irb):3:in `new'
    from (irb):3
    from /Users/rose/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/bin/irb:11:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to make a new <code>Dog</code> with 0 arguments, and Ruby was expecting 1. So Ruby blew up. This is arity checking at work.</p>

<p>JavaScript does not care about arity! Here&rsquo;s photographic proof (this is a lot easier to see in the browser&rsquo;s JavaScript console):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/js-no-arity-checking.png" width="700" height="700" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>To review what just happened:</p>

<ul>
<li>I made a constructor function for <code>Dog</code> (yeah, functions are really all-purpose in JavaScript, so that right there was a class definition of sorts).</li>
<li>In this constructor function, I said that <code>Dog</code> takes a <code>name</code>.</li>
<li>I made a new <code>Dog</code>, <code>fido</code>, and did not pass in any arguments.</li>
<li>JavaScript did not blow up.</li>
<li>Just to be sure, I asked JavaScript to show me <code>fido</code>.</li>
<li>JavaScript returned a <code>Dog</code> object with a <code>name</code> of <code>undefined</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Whenever it can, JavaScript will try to help you out, whether you want it to or not. If you say a <code>Dog</code> has a <code>name</code> and then forget to give it one, JavaScript will trust that this was your intent and will throw in an <code>undefined</code> rather than yelling at you.</p>

<h2>Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks</h2>

<p>Ruby cares about defining an object&rsquo;s attributes and behaviors up front. Objects in Ruby behave in consistent and predicatable ways.</p>

<p>Using our prior definition of the <code>Dog</code> class, Ruby will let us know that we haven&rsquo;t taught <code>Dog</code>s to bark yet:</p>

<pre><code class="console">2.1.2 :001 &gt; require 'ruby.rb'
 =&gt; true 
2.1.2 :002 &gt; fido = Dog.new('Fido')
 =&gt; #&lt;Dog:0x007f9fd5757c78 @name="Fido"&gt; 
2.1.2 :003 &gt; fido.bark
NoMethodError: undefined method `bark' for #&lt;Dog:0x007f9fd5757c78 @name="Fido"&gt;
    from (irb):3
    from /Users/rose/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/bin/irb:11:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>Of course! We did not define a <code>bark</code> method, so we get a predictable <code>NoMethodError</code>.</p>

<p>JavaScript doesn&rsquo;t care about defining all of an object&rsquo;s attributes and behaviors up front, and pretty much lets you do whatever you want, whenever you want. Here&rsquo;s a continuation of the console session above:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/js-fido-barks.png" width="700" height="700" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<ul>
<li>I asked <code>fido</code> to bark, having never defined a <code>bark</code> function or attribute. JavaScript quietly returned <code>undefined</code>.</li>
<li>I told JavaScript to give <code>fido.bark</code> the value of <code>'woof'</code>, and JavaScript happily obliged.</li>
<li>Now not only can <code>fido</code> bark, but the <code>Dog</code> object that is <code>fido</code> has been fundamentally altered, now containing a new <code>bark</code> attribute!</li>
</ul>


<p>So, can all <code>Dog</code>s bark now?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/js-spot-cant-bark.png" width="700" height="700" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>No, they cannot. Now the definition of <code>Dog</code> is a bit of a mess - <code>fido</code> is a <code>Dog</code> that can bark, while <code>spot</code> can&rsquo;t. The very nature of <code>Dog</code>-ness has been brought into question, and JavaScript is fine with all of this. No errors, no complaining. For better or for worse.</p>

<h2>Playing with Global Scope</h2>

<p>This one is extra weird, so get ready.</p>

<p>In the hierarchy of Ruby objects, <code>main</code> is the top level:</p>

<pre><code class="console">♥ irb
2.1.2 :001 &gt; self
 =&gt; main 
2.1.2 :002 &gt; self.class
 =&gt; Object 
2.1.2 :003 &gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d want to mess with <code>main</code>, and Ruby makes certain it&rsquo;s not easy to do so (in fact, it&rsquo;s impossible to do so by accident):</p>

<pre><code class="console">2.1.2 :003 &gt; self.name
NoMethodError: undefined method `name' for main:Object
    from (irb):3
    from /Users/rose/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/bin/irb:11:in `&lt;main&gt;'
2.1.2 :004 &gt; self.name = "Rose"
NoMethodError: undefined method `name=' for main:Object
    from (irb):4
    from /Users/rose/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.2/bin/irb:11:in `&lt;main&gt;'
2.1.2 :005 &gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Want to mess with the top-level object in JavaScript? Go right ahead, JavaScript doesn&rsquo;t care!</p>

<pre><code class="console">&gt;&gt;&gt; this.name
undefined
&gt;&gt;&gt; this.name = "Rose"
Rose
&gt;&gt;&gt; this
[object global]
&gt;&gt;&gt; this.name
Rose
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>I just named the global object after myself, and JavaScript did not care one bit. This example is a bit contrived, but believe me that some undesireable things can happen if you don&rsquo;t watch out for global assignment. Here&rsquo;s a (slightly) less contrived example:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript javascript-ruby-comparison/javascript.js">function Dog(name){
    this.name = name;
    this.hunger = true;
    this.bowl = 'full';
}

Dog.prototype.checkNeeds = function() {
    if(this.hunger === true){
        (function feed(){
            this.hunger = false;
            this.bowl = 'empty';
        })();
    } else {
        (function play(){
            this.hunger = true;
        })();
    }
};

var fido = new Dog('Fido');

debug(fido.hunger);

fido.checkNeeds();

debug(fido.hunger);
debug(this.hunger);
debug(this);
</code></pre>

<p>If I run this code, here&rsquo;s what my <code>debug</code> statements reveal:</p>

<pre><code class="console">♥ jsc javascript.js 
--&gt; true            // fido was born hungry
--&gt; true            // after calling checkNeeds(), he's still hungry...
--&gt; false           // ...but this isn't hungry...
--&gt; [object global] // because we fed the global object instead of fido!
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, Bad Things can happen when the global object is always available. Fortunately, there is a way for you to make JavaScript care about this! You just have to tell JavaScript to <code>use strict</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript javascript-ruby-comparison/javascript.js">'use strict';

function Dog(name){
    // the rest of my code...
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when we run the code, JavaScript will blow up just the way we want it to!</p>

<pre><code class="console">♥ jsc javascript.js 
--&gt; true
Exception: TypeError: Attempted to assign to readonly property.
feed@javascript.js:12:17
checkNeeds@javascript.js:14:11
global code@javascript.js:24:16
</code></pre>

<h2>The Moral of the Story</h2>

<p>This was a long post, and it probably could get longer. But I think this is enough to chew on for now. The bottom line is that JavaScript has some crazy ways, but these ways are not unlearnable, and the reward for learning them is a much saner coding experience. If you understand the quirks, remember your <code>var</code>s, and always <code>use strict</code>, you and JavaScript can be unstoppable, just like the honey badger.</p>

    <link href="http://roseweixel.github.io/blog/2014/10/28/flash-messages-with-sessions-in-sinatra/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-28T23:18:15-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://roseweixel.github.io/blog/2014/10/28/flash-messages-with-sessions-in-sinatra</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> is a DSL (domain specific language) for building small dynamic web apps with all the beauty of Ruby and without the bulk of Rails. Recently, my <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> classmates and I built a simple playlist app that allows users to perform all the basic CRUD operations on songs - you can create, retrieve, update, and destroy them. Emulating <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#crud-verbs-and-actions">RESTful routes for these actions (à la Rails)</a>, I created something like the following:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby app/controllers/songs_controller.rb">
class SongsController &lt; ApplicationController

  get '/songs' do
    @songs = Song.all
    erb :"songs/index"
  end

  get '/songs/new' do
    erb :"songs/new"
  end

  post '/songs' do
    @song = Song.create(params[:song])
    redirect :"/songs/#{@song.id}"
  end

  get '/songs/:id' do
    @song = Song.find(params[:id])
    erb :"songs/show"
  end

  get '/songs/:id/edit' do
    @song = Song.find(params[:id])
    erb :"songs/edit"
  end

  post '/songs/:id' do
    @song = Song.find(params[:id])
    @song.update(params[:song])
    redirect :"/songs/#{@song.id}"
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>With the corresponding models and views that make these routes real, a working web app was born. Pretty darn cool. But there was a feature in the spec that was still left to add, and it became a bit of a challenge:</p>

<p>Whenever a song is created or updated, the user should see a message like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/song_success_message.png" width="700" height="700" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I wanted to achieve:</p>

<ul>
<li>The user fills out the form at <code>songs/new</code> and clicks &lsquo;Submit&rsquo;.</li>
<li>The newly created song&rsquo;s show page at <code>songs/:id</code> is rendered with a success message.</li>
<li>The user reloads the page (or navagates away and back), and *poof* the success message is gone.</li>
</ul>


<p>In order to get this to work, I would have to somehow pass a message from one action in the controller to another. The create (or update) action would have to pass a message along to the show action which would pass this message along to the view. It would be nice to have something like an envelope called <code>success_message</code> that could hold one of three values at any given time:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>"Successfully created song."</code> (right after the song is created)</li>
<li><code>"Successfully updated song."</code> (right after the song is updated)</li>
<li><code>nil</code> (immediately after the success message is rendered in the view)</li>
</ul>


<p><a name="erb"></a>
According to this vision, I was able to put some yet-to-be-functional code in <code>songs/show.erb</code>:</p>

<p>&#8220;`erb</p>

<!-- this bit of code at the bottom of the page would reveal the contents of the success message if it isn't nil -->


<p>&lt;% if @success_message %>
  <div id="success" style="border: 2px solid green;">
  &lt;%= @success_message %>
  </div>
&lt;% end %>
&#8220;`</p>

<p>But how would <code>@success_message</code>, which would have to be definied in the show action in order for the show page to know about it, be able to hold a message the was created in another controller action (create or update)?</p>

<p>I knew that <code>params</code> is one such data object that holds values that can be passed from one action to another, but as it is already the envelope for carrying and delivering form data entered by the user, it didn&rsquo;t seem like the right place for a success message to live. If only there was some other vessel, like params, but not&hellip;</p>

<p><a name="first_step"></a>
There is. It&rsquo;s a session! It becomes available to you as soon as you put this in your application controller:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class ApplicationController &lt; Sinatra::Base
  ...
  # add this line to enable the magic
  enable :sessions
end
</code></pre>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve added that, you get this handy little object called <code>session</code> that you can access in any of your controllers, which can in turn pass along any value it contains to a view.  Just to see what it looked like before doing anything with it, I put a <code>binding.pry</code> inside my index action in <code>songs_controller.rb</code>, fired off <code>shotgun</code>, and loaded the index page on my local server. Here&rsquo;s what pry spat out when I asked it what <code>session</code> was:</p>

<pre><code class="irb">[1] pry(#&lt;SongsController&gt;)&gt; session
=&gt; {"session_id"=&gt;"857d0d856ee646d76204c1138cf57fc497f80ffd85fef19befdbb26f60f8e022", "csrf"=&gt;"598119612cef0d88134413ddd54bad52", "tracking"=&gt;{"HTTP_USER_AGENT"=&gt;"7be1a42d74a413474898ddb9adfef9a5a84719e3", "HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE"=&gt;"66eae971492938c2dcc2fb1ddc8d7ec3196037da"}}
</code></pre>

<p>Here it is again, split up onto several lines for readability:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">{
  "session_id"=&gt;"857d0d856ee646d76204c1138cf57fc497f80ffd85fef19befdbb26f60f8e022",
  "csrf"=&gt;"598119612cef0d88134413ddd54bad52",
  "tracking"=&gt;{
      "HTTP_USER_AGENT"=&gt;"7be1a42d74a413474898ddb9adfef9a5a84719e3",
      "HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE"=&gt;"66eae971492938c2dcc2fb1ddc8d7ec3196037da"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So that&rsquo;s our session object, before we&rsquo;ve done anything with it. Inside it there&rsquo;s <code>"session_id"</code>, a unique key that lives inside your cookie for the life of your session. What else is in there? Having just learned about preventing cross-site request forgery, I presumed <code>"csrf"=&gt;"598119612cef0d88134413ddd54bad52"</code> to be the CSRF token. If you want to learn more about this (and you should!), read about it <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">here</a>. Finally there&rsquo;s <code>"tracking"</code>, which I believe holds information about the user&rsquo;s browser. For our current purposes (creating a flash message), we don&rsquo;t need to care about these values, but it helps to see how session is structured and what kinds of things it can contain.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move on and see how we can use this session object to help us with our success message.</p>

<p>Before doing anything to it, it would help to understand what kind of object <code>session</code> is. It looks like an ordinary Ruby hash, but in fact it is a special kind of Rack object. Why guess when you can <code>pry</code> it?</p>

<pre><code class="irb">[2] pry(#&lt;SongsController&gt;)&gt; session.class
=&gt; Rack::Session::Abstract::SessionHash
</code></pre>

<p>As it turns out, the <code>SessionHash</code> object has a lot in common with a <code>Hash</code> object. 103 methods in common (out of 177 total), to be exact:</p>

<pre><code class="irb">[3] pry(#&lt;SongsController&gt;)&gt; session.methods.select{ |method| Hash.methods.include?(method) }.count
=&gt; 103
</code></pre>

<p>One hash-like thing you can do with <code>session</code> is put new keys into it, with values that you can assign and change at your whim. And since the session persists from one HTTP request to another, it can pass values around from one action in the controller to another. This sounded like just the right object to hold the success message!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I did (after enabling sessions, as shown <a href="#first_step">above</a>):</p>

<p>1) At the bottom of my create action (immediately before redirecting to the show page), I added a <code>:success_message</code> key to <code>session</code>, setting its value to the one-time message I want my users to see:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby songs_controller.rb">  post '/songs' do
    @song = Song.create(params[:song])

    session[:success_message] = "Successfully created song."

    redirect :"/songs/#{@song.id}"
  end
</code></pre>

<p>2) I did the same thing for my update action:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">  post '/songs/:id' do
    @song = Song.find(params[:id])
    @song.update(params[:song])

    session[:success_message] = "Song successfully updated."

    redirect :"/songs/#{@song.id}"
  end
</code></pre>

<p>3) Then, I added some code at the top of the show action to pass this message along so it could be rendered by the <a href="#erb">erb template</a> in the view, and to ensure that the message is immediately set to <code>nil</code> so it will only render once:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">  get '/songs/:id' do
    @song = Song.find(params[:id])

    @success_message = session[:success_message]
    session[:success_message] = nil

    erb :'songs/show'
  end
</code></pre>

<p>Now my success message behaves exactly as I imaged it should, appearing and disappearing at the appropriate times.</p>

<p>Due to the stateless nature of HTTP requests, had I simply used an instance variable <code>@success_message</code> inside these <code>get</code> and <code>post</code> actions, any value assigned to it would have been instantly forgotten the moment another request was made. The <code>@success_message</code> inside the two actions would have in fact been completely out of each other&rsquo;s scope. The session, however, is available across all actions.</p>

<p>This ability to fake statefulness in your controllers opens up a world of functionality other than flash messages, not the least of which is maintaining a user&rsquo;s &ldquo;logged in&rdquo; state as they browse from one page to another. Without sessions, almost all of the interactions and transactions that occur over the Internet as we know it could not even happen.</p>

<p>So if you haven&rsquo;t yet, sit down and get to know the powerful little session. It&rsquo;s definitely worth prying into.</p>
